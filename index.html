      <p class="leading-relaxed">Welcome to My Campaign Website
I’m James Waibauru, and this platform represents more than just a campaign, it represents who I am, what I stand for, and the bold vision I have for Sogeri and for Papua New Guinea.

I am deeply passionate about leadership that creates real change. I believe in a Sogeri where students are not only empowered but are included in decision-making where there is a strong, transparent relationship between the student body and the school administration. I want to bridge that gap and ensure that every student’s voice is valued and acted upon.

My goal is to tackle the issues we face today. Whether it's outdated infrastructure, limited student engagement, or a lack of innovation, not just for our time here, but for all the future Sogerians who will walk these grounds after us. This is about laying the foundation for generations to come. I want to create systems, opportunities, and improvements that outlast me so that every student who comes after us inherits a better, stronger, and more united school.

I don’t just bring ideas
I bring action. I believe that with the right leadership, we can turn these visions into reality and lead a transformation that uplifts all of us.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">My Vision</h2>
        <li>Building and fostering a transparent and open relationship between the student body and the school administration. I want every student to feel empowered to raise concerns about issues that affect them, rather than remaining silent. By strengthening this relationship, we will create a platform where students can confidently speak up for what is right and bring attention to matters that impact their well-being and academic experience.</li>

        <li>Taking Sogeri National School of Excellence back to consistently being #1 through my student led initiative. Not only would this initiative benefit our Era, but it would continue to further benefit all SogeriNSOE students in the future</li>

        <li>One of my core visions is to see a Sogeri where living decency is paramount. I envision a school environment free from issues such as rundown ablution blocks, poorly lit areas, bed bug infestations, and broken appliances like faulty switches and classroom lights. These are basic necessities that directly affect our daily lives.
<p>
            To address these challenges, I aim to initiate sustainable avenues through which the school can generate revenue, rather than relying solely on the administration. As part of the SRC, I am committed to leading and working alongside students to make these improvements a reality</li>
